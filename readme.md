## Overview

This project provides a very simple user defined language file for Notepad++ that does some basic syntax highlighting for jade texts.


## Usage

Installation instructions (taken from Notepad++ Web site [1]):

1. Download the user-defined language to your computer
2. Open the file with your favourite text editor (such as notepad++ or
   notepad)
3. Click start, run, type (or paste in) %APPDATA%\Notepad++ then click ok
4. Open userDefineLang.xml with a text editor
5. If this is the first userdefined language you are adding, copy/paste the
   entire first file (which you downloaded) into the userDefineLang.xml, 
   replacing all that was there. If this is the second or more language you 
   add, simply copy everything from the first file starting at <UserLang...> 
   to </UserLang> and paste it at the end of the userDefineLang.xml right 
   before </NotepadPlus>
6. Save the newly improved userDefineLang.xml
